                - add to the ‘analysis’:
                    + a basis in the literal meaning of will
                - add to the ‘yield’:
                  \ + a candidate for the popular notion of the meaning of life
                  \\ with the other claims, this one now seems superfluous
                    + a moral authority of God-like stature
                        - rights, duties and [a [sense of]] purpose as close to God-given
                          as one may get without supernatural suppositions
                        - freedom consists in self-provision
                            - ultimately nothing that a human (nor indeed humanity) has is self-provided
                            - all was given by the freedom of a will that is not its own,
                              but that of its creator

          of extinction avoidance, complete with dated citations.  Exclude from the list arguments
          that are based on maximizing a valued good, such as happiness or lives lived.

                    • Toby Ord (2024) - Argues that humanity has intrinsic value beyond just the sum
                      of individual human lives, and that we have an obligation to preserve this.
                        : see https://academic.oup.com/monist/article/107/2/99/7629690?login=false
                    • Johann Frick (2017) - Contends that humanity has "final value" that should be
                      cherished and protected, distinct from simply creating more happy people.
                        : see https://academic.oup.com/monist/article/107/2/99/7629690?login=false
                    • Nick Bostrom (2013) - Proposes that we have a stronger moral reason to prevent
                      catastrophes that would kill the entire human population compared to
                      smaller-scale disasters, based on the unique value of humanity's continued
                      existence.

                - This list is relatively short because many arguments for avoiding extinction are
                  based on maximizing goods like happiness or the number of lives lived, which were
                  excluded per the query instructions.  The philosophers listed above argue for
                  humanity's intrinsic or unique value as a reason to avoid extinction, rather than
                  solely focusing on maximizing positive outcomes.

    definition of morals, as distinct from other norms
        - by norms I mean standards of right and wrong behaviour
            \ not to say ‘principles’, which I reserve for fundamental truths or propositions

        morals: agent-neutral norms of [right] action

             | [at once] a) unimpeachable, b) immortal and c) a creator [and sustainer]
               whose creatures we are

                - lately the plan is to warrant the *whole ethic* by pointing to several problems,
                  one being that of grounding an ethic such that it could ‘survive the theoretic
                  skepticism of a scientific age’

                    1. directly ground in a practical interpretation of theoretic constraints on telicity
                      not a principle of reason, but those of behaviour (morals)
                    2. find in practical reason the proper seat for such principles
                    3. resolve them (in the simplest case) to a single autotelic principle of reason
                - the two other problems, namely of motivation and fit with society, are not the
                  fundamental problems to solve, nor questions to answer
                    : re `two other.+namely of motivation and.+society` see notepad:2024-2-12b(1)
                    - thus I do not take them as warranting the ethic and moving me to write it
                    - already I was moved, already I saw the demands on society as feasible,
                      with the sole provision of first finding a justifying theory
                !! I would lose the clean symmetry and unity of the relation between theory and practice
                  as regards constraints, one that is fundamentally rational in being a relation
                  between the theoretic and practical uses of reason
                    - and regardless of what I take to warrant the ethic itself, a two-stage argument
                      — via a) reason to b) morality — is easier and safer than one giant leap

        - both base premises — (a) a principle of reason and (b) its moral interpretation —
          I argue for by the same conservative strategy: conformant fidelity to
          an independently verified core structure which serves as a flying buttress

    nature, as a potential authority
        - we can still think of nature as a creator and sustainer
        - yet knowing of natural selection, no longer can we think of it as normative in itself
        - nature enforces directly, not indirectly through approvals
    dismissing nature, as the authority
        / so allowing me to focus on reason alone
        - nature approves nothing
            ∵ nature directly yields no approvals (or other norms)
                - nature might yield an authority, which authority then yields
                  an approval (or other norm)
                - nature and that authority would not be identical, however, though they were related
                + clarify; I must at least explain that approvals (or other norms)
                  are inherently|essentially direct

        : re `authority` see `approved by an ${same}` @ `^^definition of morals`i
        - unlike nature, reason is not given
            - rather it is at once elusive and {impossible to dismiss|indismissable}
            - impossible to dismiss because its normative verdicts are incontestable,
              yet elusive because the precise norms behind it are difficult to pin down
        - the remainder of the ethic’s argument is to be structured as a [hypothetic] investigation
            - namely:
                - could reason be the moral authority?

        | a standard of rationality or reasoning
            : cf. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ontology/#Logi : While formerly I had
              thought to categorize the standard as one among the different conceptions of logic
              (particularly the one that conceives of logical constants), now I suspect I should be
              looking at conceptions not of logic, but of rationality or *theories of rationality* as
              the author puts it.
            / “In its original meaning, the word ‘rational’ referred to the faculty of reason — the
              capacity for reasoning. … [It] later came also to express a normative concept — the
              concept of the proper use of this faculty [a standard for reasoning].”

        | principles
            - despite its constitution being forced by natural selection, reason in hindsight
              (through its agents) sees itself only as a set of fundamental norms (principles)
              of pure reason, divorced of outside influence
            - we do not think anything makes reason what it is
            - we think of reason as an independent normative authority
              resting on nothing more fundamental than itself
                - we expect to be able to use it as such, consult it as such
            - therefore we think of reason as a fundamental set of norms (principles)
              of pure reason
                - one might at times distinguish between logic disembodied
                  and reason embodied as a power of mind based on that logic
                - but always one thinks of the two as tightly bound, if not identical
          \ - it would be costly to break with this
          \     - it would be unsettling
          \     - it would undermine my previous appeals to consistency|harmony
          \       as a principle

          \ - here is warrant, without pleading, for the telic principle (already warranted)
          \   to be *auto*telic
          \     - for consistency|harmony (again) we would expect the telic principle *too*
          \       to be of pure reason, independent of outside influences,
          \       and resting on nothing more fundamental than reason itself
          \     - then reason cannot take its end from nature, and so rest on nature
          \     - then the only possibility that remains is for reason to be autotelic

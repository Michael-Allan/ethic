                                    - The principles of reason are those which natural selection
                                      could plausibly put into reason unconscious, that reason
                                      conscious (philosophy) cannot subsequently reject as
                                      improper to it.
                                    - Natural selection would inject an autotelic principle.
                                        : see notepad:2023-5-25j : Else natural selection would
                                          long ago have jettisoned our large, energy-intensive
                                          brain as useless baggage.
                                        - This principle would be constrained to kinship groups.
                                        !! One could convincingly counter that we, like subrational
                                          species, are autotelic wholly by instinct.
                                    - Reason conscious would enlarge that constraint to all
                                      rational agents, for otherwise it would be arbitrary.
                                    - Reason conscious could not, however, reject it by reason.
                1. Self-stable rights.
                    - Consider how presumptious and tenacious these rights are.
                        - Having once taken hold, they cannot by reason be rejected.
                    - I will propose there exists a principle of reason equally tenacious
                      and if necessary presumptious.
                    - These being conditions of reason lead to:

                      else natural selection would long ago have jettisoned our large,
                      energy-intensive brain as useless baggage.
                        - For reason could not originally have been the author of its own principles,
                          so conjuring them out of nothing.
                        - Rather natural selection put them there, much in its own image,
                          and only later did reason attain autonomy.
                            - As natural selection gives and autotelic principle to its populations,
                              so reason gives an autotelic principle to its communities.
                    - Arguing also that reason, having lifted itself from a state of nature (and us
                      with it), is now the author of its principles.
                        - We could now reject any of its given principles, in other words,
                          provided we had good reason to.
                        - But we have no reason at all to reject this one.
                    - The existential rule is satisfied by a principle of reason, just as the
                      conditions of existence are satisfied by natural selection.

                          of life, and being in all cases subjected to the several laws of growth.
                          Hence, in fact, the law of the Conditions of Existence is the higher law ; as
                          it includes, through the inheritance of former adaptations, that of Unity of

                  hopeful end-search structure — ‘To what end?’ it asks, and again ‘To what end?’.
                - I have learned that by taking its pretensions seriously — giving them free reign, so to
                  speak — reason delivers up its secrets, yielding not only a principle sufficient to an
                  ethic [supportive of freedom and rights] (as Kant foresaw {and others, Schneewind?}),

          \       from which one must step back, I think, and conclude that practical reason
          \       is justified in itself.
        - No other end is justified in itself — that is the assumption here.
        - Here lineal rational community is a necessary end.
            / QED
            ∵ We will (I assume) remain finite agents.
                / Infinite rational agents (omniscient, omnipotent and otherwise perfect)
                  would fall outside of the scope of this ethic.
            ∵ No finite agent can reasonably believe himself to be immortal.
            ∵ Among mortal agents, lineal rational community is a necessary condition
              for the maintenance of practical reason.
                - Clearly the maintenance of practical reason among such agents entails
                  the reproduction of rational agency across generations.
                - The question is whether this must be done knowingly
                  and thus constitute (lineal rational) community.
                    - If two sides of a generational boundary are aware of the reproduction
                      between them, then they *share* rational agency *in common*
                      and this constitutes lineal rational *community*.
                - Such awareness is natural for humans.
                - To see whether it is necessary in general, it helps to look at an extreme case
                  in which community is wholly temporal.
                    - Here community consists in the rational agency of one individual, say, contributing
                      to that of another across a span of time wherein neither exists.
                    - If the contribution is deliberate on one side and recognized on the other,
                      then rational agency is shared in common (knowingly that is),
                      and this is a case of lineal rational community.
                    - That is how it must be done.
                        ∵ Only then would it be reasonable to expect that the line *might* endure
                          indefinitely, as would be necessary to the maintenance of practical reason.
                            ∵ Otherwise the continuation of the line would be a matter of chance
                              over the course of infinity, which makes failure all but certain,
                              if not outright certain.
                            - Nor would it help for the individual agent to produce a large
                              number of such lines if each were merely an unknowing replica.
                                - Multiplication could not reasonably be expected to suffice to stabilize
                                  the outcome, for it would result only in a very large yet finite number
                                  of lines, each eventually suffering the same fate as a single line.
                                - Multiplication means nothing against infinity.
                            - Rational will alone can oppose chance and stabilize the outcome,
                              but this requires awareness of what is going on.
            ∵ Practical reason is a necessary end.

                - Ends other than the lineal rational community may be justified in themselves —
                  that is the assumption here.
                    \ [universal fact as opposed to personal belief]
                - Here lineal rational community is a necessary end.
                    / QED
                ∵ Only two cases are possible, and in each lineal rational community either
                  a) already is an end, or b) is a necessary end:
                        a) One’s grounding end already *is* lineal rational community.
                        b) One’s grounding end is other than lineal rational community.
                            - Here lineal rational community is a necessary end.
                                ∵ That end is necessary to the end one anticipates for the verge of
                                  death, namely lineal telic community.
                                    - A finite agent must expect to be mortal and so anticipate his own
                                      death and the conditions of holding on to reason at that point.
                                - I think my argument here was that one must hold that end *throughout
                                  life*, if only because its object (rational community) is necessary to
                                  holding it at the *end of life*.
                                postulate: No agent-relative end is justified in itself.
                                  \ ∵ That end would have to function as a ground also of the present,

                                  \ ∵ An agent-relative ground would be out of scope for the present,
                                  \   formal part of the theory.
                                  \     ∵ I seek a guide (to action) that is agent-neutral.

            unbounded
                - Temporally unbounded ends (other than rational community)
                  may be justified in themselves — that is the assumption here.
                    - A temporally unbounded end is (its object) to indefinitely maintain a state,
                      whereby it is unattainable in finite time.
                - In case all one’s grounding ends (other than rational community) are temporally
                  unbounded, then still rational community is a *necessary* end.
                ∵ Rational agency is a necessary condition of an unbounded end.
                ∵ Rational community is the only form of rational agency we have, or ever will have.
        claim: no temporally bounded end is justified in itself
            / Committing to this in order to avoid the difficulty of arguing for the necessity of the
              obligatory end in the case where all one’s *other* ends are temporally bounded.
            ? Why?  Only in an inert state (with no end), when (morally) it would it not matter
              either way, could one (within reason) choose to drop the necessary end.
                + Consider: this inert-state stuff is nonsense, one can have no valid reason
                  to deliberately shut reason down.
                - Morever I must deal with this inert exception in any case.
                    - Even if the community is known to be the only end justified in itself,
                      then one *could* go inert and avoid taking it.
                - All action, will and practical reason would have to cease.
                    - One could not even *willfully* maintain this state,
                      it would somehow have to maintain itself unwilled.
                - One would then die most probably.
                    - Even life support could not avail unless it arrived unwilled,
                      entailing no action, not even a nod of assent.
                    - Regardless, one would be dead in effect.
            !! I owe some kind of argument for this (even if I merely postulate it),
              yet what argument could invalidate a temporally bounded end
              without also invalidating a temporally *unbounded* one?
                - This seems to be a problem less for the claim/commitment in itself,
                  and more for how I go about warranting or otherwise introducing it.
                - Maybe views from different standpoints (re justificatory reason) might help:
                    • outside of the community
                        / Without practical reason, that is.
                    • inside of the community
                        ' That’s it, we achieved the end in itself.  We can all pack it in now.
                          Or ‘break out the booze and have a ball.’
                        • inside of a person, or the person himself
                            ' Well, here I am, so I guess I achieved it.  I guess I can pack
                              it in now.  Or ‘break out the booze and have a ball.’
                    • between communities
                        / At the end of one, that is, and the potential start of another.
                        - Given the opportunity to create another world, though you and I would
                          die shortly, unable to live in it, then I/we must choose to create it.
                            - Here I would feel that we had truly achieved something.
                            - Here I would feel that reason is satisfied.
                                - I would like to do more, but what is done suffices.
                        - This has similarity to my nocturnal standpoint with Kant.
                            - If somehow I had the opportunity to ensure that we attain refuge
                              among those distant points of light, though at the cost of my own
                              life, then I think I would take it.
                            - I happily devote my life entirely to improving our odds at that.
                            - But the question is, how to do that?
            - If I am to argue for this, and do so from an *external* standpoint
              (wherefrom the self-justification of such an end is hard to see),
              then I take an objective (or at least intersubjective) point of view,
              and so it must be an objective (or intersubjective) principle that I seek.

            - The branching rate would, however, have to surpass some threshold.
                ∵ Branches would themselves branch independently of each other.
                    ∵ They could not plausibly (by mere chance) react appropiately to news (via branch
                      intercommunication) of another branch’s extinction.
                - To learn the threshold rate, I would need a model based on a branching process.

        + Dismiss ∵ chance branching has limits, at least one of which defeats it entirely.
            / This perhaps in conjunction with a sister remedy or two herein.
            - The limits of chance branching are:
                i) It does not (for us) operate at present.
                ii) It could not plausibly work indefinitely, at least not in our universe.
                    - It would be stopped by the ultimate existential hazards.
                    - But so might deliberate branching, we know of no plausible way to circumvent
                      those ultimate hazards.
                        / Though here the case does seem a little more hopeful,
                          and I think we *must* hope for this.
                    wrong!!
                        : see @ `^*iii\) It could not work for all plausible lines of agent.$`
                iii) It could not work for all plausible lines of agent.
                    - It is plausible there could exist (at some time, place) agents whose line-branching
                      probability would fall below the threshold that could sustain chance branching.
                        - Such a line would certainly go extinct if chance branching
                          were its only means of *p* decay
                        / Indeed *p* would not decay at all over the long run.
                        wrong!!
                            - For agents who choose to will their own survival, *p* reduction is
                               technical knowledge (know-how) to that end, which would itself be
                               stabilized against loss (know-how extinction, so to speak) by branching.
                            - For agents who do *not* choose to will their own survival, it makes no
                              sense to expect a principle of reason dedicated that purpose to come to
                              their rescue.
                        chart the thresholds+ for a range of *p* rates
                    - It is not implausible that we ourselves are such a line or that (by some change)
                      we will become one in future.
                    - If we knew that we were, then we would have to conclude there exists
                      a lineal-autotelic principle of reason.

                        - Else reason would be auto-destructive for us.
                    - But the principles of reason are universal and timeless.
                    - Therefore the conclusion holds already.
                    ? So might I want to reorder the argument between these two files?

                        - An isolated argument for an initial lemma might no longer make sense.
                        - The reader might need the context of the argument up front.
                        ? What does the *argument* need, what *premises*?
                            axiom: Just that set of principles that all rational agents
                              could [together] agree to constitutes practical reason.
                                - As reason is the author of its own content, this seems beyond dispute.
                            axiom: The principles of practical reason are universal and timeless.
                        ?+ How reorder the argument in order dismiss chance branching *by these axioms*
                          on account of its failure (for plausible agents) in the present case (iii).

                iv) It could not work at all in all possible universes.
                    - This one (at least) seems to enter only when I infer of the principle, for it would
                      make reason auto-destructive wherever the (empirical) physical properties of a
                      universe did not happen to be favourable to it.
                    wrong!!

    (a) I dismissed the possibility of chance being sufficient to the task.
        / The task being to keep existential risk *p* on a downward trend.

    (b) Finish dismissing the possibility of a law of nature sufficient to the task.

        i) First for a line of ideally rational agents.
            - By the lack of adequate purchase for nature to coerce their wills into branching.
            - Nature cannot provide a reason for that, short of physical force,
              and a law that physically forces branching is implausible.
        ii) Then for any line, more-or-less rational.
            - Given that (i) fails, (ii) depends on some irrational impulse to branch a line
              of rational agents.
            - I should be able to defeat this by the failure of nature in developed societies
              to push us, through such urges, to even replensish our own populations.
                - That it could neverthess drive us to populate the stars would then be absurd.
                - I think nature is done pulling our strings for us.
                - People now need a reason to reproduce.

    (c) Characterize the one remaining possibility, that of a principle of reason sufficient to the task.

        - Dealing with the qualifier on necessity — namely ‘insofar as the line is rational’ —
          by treating subrationality (on some macro-measure) as extinction.
            - This requires that:
                i) *p* include the probability of going macro-subrational;
                ii) it too — inclusion (i) — decay by *δ*; and
                iii) each branch sees any macro-subrationality of another branch,
                   as effective extinction of that branch.
                    / Branch inter-communication would thus be crucial to this means of decreasing *p*.

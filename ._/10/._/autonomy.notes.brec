    - securing the licence to make moral law (?)

        / a crucial (and promising) premise of the overall argument
            ? is it actually crucial, or even beneficial at all?
                - with or without it, still I must argue for the particular law that I make,
                  so it can really only be a proposal
                ? to offset the cost of explaining and arguing for this notion of licence or autonomy,
                  would it yield any true benefit to the overall argument?
                        | dammit, it fascinates me!
                            | it might not be a licence to make moral law (or not only so),
                              but something else (too)
                                - re the enforceability of the core rights:
                                    / what makes them, in practice, obligatory and hence moral
                                    - its inconstestability on moral grounds comes from
                                      the inconstestability of logic
                                    - its efficacy|efficiency comes from the exercise of these rights
                                      being necessary in order to violate them
                                    ? what does this suggest?
                                        - agential capacity can defend itself, tit for tat
                                            / for at root it is agency (and only thereby rational agency)
                                              that depends on (the exercise of) these rights
                                        | morality inheres in this
                                            - the normative obligation comes from the normative
                                              incontestability of enforcement, which comes from
                                              the normative incontestability of *logic* in conjunction
                                              with symmetric enforcement (denying the violator
                                              the exercise of the right he violated).

                                            - or stronger perhaps, in that enforcement rests
                                              on one’s own (unimpeachable) authority

                            - for example, in the system of ends justification and means discovery,
                              one searches for and effectively makes moral law; the system captures
                              the theory and practice of ethics
                            - in general, I am better off resting the argument on the evidence
                              of the facts/truths that align (however tenuously) with it

                          but merely touching on it
      \ - including not only licence to enforce what rests on the two core rights,
      \   but more generally (if possible) what rests on non-contradiction
      \     / I say ‘more generally’ because aside from resting on nothing further than those two rights,
      \       a non-contradictory law has further constraints
      \     - for the likeness to Kant’s categorical imperative is striking
      \\ this seems impossible, simple non-contradiction will not secure the core rights
        - this licence rests on allowing for a plurality of moral conceptions,
          some of which may be contradictory (in their ends)
            - this means that either some such conceptions are false; all are false (and morality too);
              or morality somehow is inherently plural (in its ends), at least for finite beings like us
            - yet which is the case makes no difference in practice, because we (finite beings)
              cannot ever know which is the case

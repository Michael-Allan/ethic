                                        - the fact of autotelic conformance (re reason) remains
                                        - natural selection then becomes part of the explanation (working
                                          forward by synthesis) of how the tendency behind the autotelic

                                          of the genome, or does the genome serve as an instrument
                                          for the reproductive fitness of reason?
                                            - one could explain it either way, at least till reason
                                              has a hand in disengaging from natural selection

                - I asked it in 1988
                - then quickly the clue
                - it promised an answer entailing something deep, ineffable, akin the meaning of life
                    : re `meaning of life` see @ ../13/research.notes_boneyard.brec
                - else I probably would not have come to philosophy,
                  to revisit the question through analysis

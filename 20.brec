    - After long being concerned that we are in a state of existential precarity,
      I found what I think is a workable solution for dealing with the problem,
      one whose theory I now sketch in the form of a normative ethic.
        - This then is a theory both of moral normativity and of existential practice.
        - It explains both the source of our moral norms, and the means of securing our existence.
    + possible independent sources of moral norms: nature, God or reason
    + of these, reason alone stands uncontested as a normative source in contemporary society
        + nature (naturalism) is constested
        + God (voluntarism) is constested
        + reason is unconstested as normative source (for logic)

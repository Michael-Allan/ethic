                / but allow me from this personal section to conjecture more generally,
                  for I would share my outlook without the burden of arguing for it

              what sort of life would content me?

                - it is a hugely distracting

              causes us to desire knowledge of the sort of life that would content one in retrospect
            - below I will try to answer concretely what that cause is



    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


    - reason
        - it is reason by way of desire that moves us to conform
    - the inevitability of death has long made it clear to us that ultimately the question ‘to what end?’
      wants for a satisfying answer
    - for we will be unsatisfied till we have found and pointed to a thing of value commensurate
      with our high valuation of life, but undying, that lives on to redeem that valuation
    - we call this a search for ‘the meaning of life’, or sometimes ‘the purpose of life’,
      because both worth and purpose are captured in the word ‘meaning’
        - likewise captured is reason, both through purpose and by way of ‘meaningless’
        - and it is reason that brings us the logic of value chaining
    - so three factors of motivation for knowledge here are a feeling of self-worth,
      awareness of one’s mortality, and reason
        - but it is the latter, responsive to the logical implications of the appalling conjunction
          of|between the former, a sense of value|self-worth unexplained and at risk, that carries
          the burden of {the unexpalined valuation|[a] self-worth at risk} {in moving|and moves} us
          to seek {its redemption|knowledge of the ground or fundament that alone could redeem it}

                - one’s predominant desire (to live) is ultimately unattainable
                    : ad `predominant desire.+to live` : predominant but not always dominant,
                      for it may be overridden, e.g. in risking one’s life to defend a child
                    - predominant not merely as a desire, but also as a commitment (end) and activity:
                      carrying on, holding oneself together, keeping the home fires burning
                - awareness of this (one’s mortality) brings on a crisis
                    - either it makes sense to keep the home fires burning, or it does not
                    a) if it does, then, given the fact that ultimately those fires go out,
                      it follows they must serve an end beyond themselves
                    b) if it does not, then the crisis is [all the] graver, for then one must choose
                      between a prompt death or a senseless life, a life of unreason
                    - so this a crisis of logic
                    - in resolving it most want nothing to do with (b), preferring instead to believe (a)
                    - hence a desire for what would justify that belief,
                      namely knowledge of the end that living serves
                    - so here is an explanation for that widespread desire for knowledge
                      of what often we express as ‘the purpose of life’
                - but not just any purpose will do
                    - the crisis is more fundamental than described above
                    - indicative of this is the fact that the object of the ensuing desire for knowledge
                      is more commonly expressed as ‘the *meaning* of life’
                    - a fuller|deeper analysis of the crisis will explain the preference
                      for ‘meaning’ over ‘purpose’


                | a life expended in service [unto death] must by that service be redeemed
                | the end must redeem the life that is expended in serving it
                | life’s purpose must redeem life’s loss


                + tie back to reason by using the connection between desire and value,
                  then the chaining equation between value and reason
                + thence use the connection between value/reason and explanation|teleology to connect
                  in turn to ‘meaning’ as the popular choice for expressing what is sought
                    !! ‘meaning’ has no direct sense connecting it to teleology or explanation
                        / I doubt I need this connection, I can probably dispense with it below
                        - what it has is:
                            i) a connection (usually by way of ‘meaningful’, but also ‘meaning’ itself)
                              to worthwhile and thus an axiologic connection
                            ii) connections both to purpose and (by way of ‘meaningless’) reason
                        - already the triggering facts of the crisis (our mortality and desire to live)
                          make it a crisis of value chaining in the first place
                            - so by (i) the most common expression ‘the meaning of life’
                              already is explained
                            + then transform the description (at top) of crisis and expression
                              that ensues accordingly
                        - then by both (ii) and the relation between chains of value and reason,
                          I can tie the whole thing to reason, concluding much as further below

              \         • theoretic and practical standpoints in regard to rational teleology?
              \ - in any case, I think this will enable me to infer:
                - I think this will enable me to infer:
                    - in the widespread desire for knowledge of the meaning of life
                      the desideratum is the explanation of life in axiologic terms,
                      in terms of a thing beyond life that makes it worth living
                        - we expect a thing of value commensurate with our desire to live
                        / this is logical
                    - what we desire to know is a reason for life, a reason to carry on,
                      a reason to do anything
                    - what we desire to know is a ground
                    - the foregoing shows that, given the facts of our mortality and desire to live,
                      it is logic through the power of mind based on logic, namely reason,
                      what transfers our desire to the knowledge of a ground

                                - for the meaning of the question itself lies in its origin
                                - thus today’s explanation of the situation (myth) does not satisfy
                                - hmmm, it does not satisfy from a *practical* standpoint
                                    : cf. `^*\?\+ why does that not satisfy me\?$` @
                                      `^*- the only sense given to me is theoretic$`
                        - for the situation is just that: life in the face of mortality
                        ∴ desire for knowledge of what is commonly expressed as ‘the meaning of life’
                        ?+ then is it that this rises to the plural level, where it becomes mythic,
                          for there the question of origin *also* lies open?
                            : cf. notepad:2024-9-22f : practical sense ‘(given mortality) means
                              an object beyond one’s own life, thus impersonal’
                    | ∵ the situation of the singular-self makes no sense, thus logically we think of the
                      plural-self, where it happens desire presents no obvious answer?
            |
                - certainly the answer most satisfying from a personal perspective is ruled out
                    - self-service can hardly satisfy as an ultimate end
                      when ultimately the self is unserviceable
                - but also outruled here, I think, is the only obvious answer
                    - we did not, for instance, jump from the premise of the singular subject being
                      outruled by its mortality to conclude that obviously the plural is the answer
                    - rather the question has remained wide open

    !! stuck re the form of my argument
        | I am going about it backards
            | better to answer re the particular object (knowledge of a ground),
              telling precisely how *that* object in particular came to be desired
                + put the object in the title
                + so answer, based on how reason desires (causes us to desire) for any desired ⁠O⁠
                  knowledge both of viable means and a valid end
                    - then we have noticed in regard to the latter that the results of our searches
                      tend to be at once:
                        a) convergent
                        b) increasingly unclear
                        c) unsatisfying in terms of validity
                            - requring yet a further end to validate it, and so on
                    - logic then implies need of a) convergence on a b) clear
                      and c) validity-satifying end, namely a ground
            | better might be to claim|assume that already we are moved to conform,
              but (as I argue below) through being unaware of the source
              misperceive the object or perceive it only dimly
                ?+ what support for this claim|assumption?
                    | we expect moral norms to already be reflected in society,
                      already be more-or-less conformed to
                    | as with Kant, already we know what is right and wrong
                - then I identify a likely candidate (here the purpose/meaning of life stuff)
                    - I can hypothesis it so, or claim it at this point
                - then I explain how it is (or could be) reason that so moves us
    |
        - reason
        - it is reason by way of desire that moves us to conform
        - sometimes an object of desire is but dimly perceived
          till one perceives the source of desire
            - such is the case with that elusive object of desire
              commonly called the purpose or meaning of life
            | or so I will argue



            | yet what could be the source of this desire, so widespread in modern society,
              if not reason?
            | here I have
                - on one hand, an elusive eptistemic object
                  the desiring of which is widespread in modern society,
                  namely knowledge of the purpose or meaning of life,
                  whose source is unknown to me
                - on the other, an elusive eptistemic object,
                  the willing of which is a universal obligation,
                  namely knowledge of a ground of practical reason, or the fundaments of morals,
                  whose source I know to be reason



        - it is reason by way of desire that moves us to conform,
          moves us to will that knowledge that logic bids us will

        - reason
        - it is reason by way of desire that moves us to conform,
          moves us to will that knowledge that logic bids us will
        - sometimes an object of desire is dimly perceived
          till one first perceives the source of that desire
        - such is the case
            | with a desire that is widespread in modern society,
              namely a longing for purpose and meaning

    - what to do?
    - one way to answer:
            - it being an absolute question of practice:
        - a practical reason, timeless and devoid of context
        - an end justified in itself, reason in itself
        - reason itself eternal
    - another way to answer:
            - it being an absolute question of action:
        - an absolute principle of action
            - one way to find it:
        - an essence of action
            - one way to find it:
        - an existential mechanism of agency
        - one way to find it:
            - past origin of agency
            - two alternative origins
            - their existential mechanisms
            - our disengagement from them
            - causes of disengagement
            - common factor reason
        - another way to find it:
            - future prospects of agency
            - mathematic model of agential endurance
            - three alternatives: contingency, theoretic and practical necessity

            - only practical necessity could yield the sought principle
            - practical necessity implies a principle of pure practical reason
            - autotelic principle of reason
                / a principle of pure practical reason that Kant seems to have overlooked
                - warrant in a criterion common to all principles of practical reason,
                  namely success vs. failure of reason
            - constitutive of reason, agents of reason and their society

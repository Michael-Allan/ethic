                                - having found a candidate purpose/reason, the question becomes:
                                  is it valid?  is practical reason indeed autotelic?

                                    - entitled to say we have a plausible candidate for a (supreme) norm
                                    - we should lend it some credence on that account
                                    ! that just above is empty words
                                        ? how then state succinctly the premise by which I proceed hence
                                            - a form (of telicity) is given or suggested or hypothesized
                                                ? by what premise?
                                                    i) a principle of conservation
                                                        - taking the prior form as normative, and so
                                                          hewing the new as near as possible to it
                                                    ii) a principle of parsimony
                                                        - taking the simplest form compatible with (i);
                                                          viz. the simplest conservative form
                                            - hence consideration moves to its fulfillment,
                                              to function or whatnot
                                    - with that, we gain access to an interesting question
                                    ? does then this candidate (credence lent) fulfill the schematic
                                      conditions by moving us on the theoretic side?

                                    - the question is interesting: first ∵ it is empirical and inviting
                                      on that score; and second, ∵ if the answer is affirmative, then:
                                            - ad empirical:
                                                - looking forward, mathematics assures us of a positive
                                                  empirical measure eventually, should we (or any other)
                                                  still exist to take it
                                                ∵ outward conformance to the norm (to its form, that is)
                                                  by chance alone is less likely the farther we go
                                                    / on the plausible assumption of barriers to chance,
                                                      like the one at present, e.g. at cosmic boundaries
                                                    - eventually it would stand as evidence
                                        i) no skeptic can doubt it on naturalistic/theoretic criteria,

                                        ii) no skeptic can doubt it on practical criteria, for manifestly
                                          (given just above) it delivers a reason for action, again as

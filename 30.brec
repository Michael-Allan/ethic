    - the previous file came to an end with two revealed truths

          $$ \begin{align} \require{mathtools}
              \mathscr{T}_d \coloneqq\;
                      & \style{font-family:var(--root-family)}{
                  \text{nearly everyone strives to maintain his or her personal security and freedom of action}} \\[-0.4ex]
                      & \style{font-family:var(--root-family)}{
                  \text{near a maximum}} \\[1ex]
              \mathscr{T}_r \coloneqq\;
                      & \style{font-family:var(--root-family)}{
                  \text{almost everywhere we acknowledge rights of personal security and freedom of action}}
              \end{align} $$

        : re `came to an end.+(\{T\}_d .+ \$\$)$`s see `comes to an end.+${same}$`s @ 20.brec
    - my task now is to test whether either truth could serve as premise \(T\) for an argument
      that concludes with moral duty \(A\)

          $$ T \to A $$

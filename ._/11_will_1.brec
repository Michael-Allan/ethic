        ⁠\bf W⁠: ⁠S⁠ wills ⁠O⁠ iff ⁠S⁠ knowingly binds itself to becoming a cause of ⁠O⁠ as its effect
            \ subject ⁠S⁠ and object ⁠O⁠, that is
            : cf. `^*Kant.+1785.+Groundwork` @ sources.brec : ‘for in the willing of an object,
              as my effect, my causality is already thought, as an acting cause’ 4:417

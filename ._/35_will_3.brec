                - closely related and (I think) inferrable|implied is:
                    / not only the necessity of synthetic reasoning, as per Kant
                      (and possibly an outdated term of art), but:
                    - the necessity of self-determination
            | postulate that no moral fundament is knowable by analytic inferences
                    / plausible, the stubborn persistence of moral controversy standing as a witness
                    - all premises (outside of moral-contextually given will etc.) being suspect,
                      there is no uncontroversial analytic path to a moral normative conclusion
                    / some support for this (enough maybe to serve as an introductory frame)
                      comes from our vague (dialectic) definition of will (etc.) which admits
                      of no conclusive analysis without a preceding synthetic step in order
                      to sharpen it (with conditions), a step that inevitably invites
                      controversy owing to the uncertaintly of its justification
                |
                    - any sound argument for such a conclusion must be synthetic
                        / as it seems Kant (no doubt with others of his day) held
                    - but the only kind of synthetic argument with a claim to objectivity,
                      and thus avoidance of controversy, is the a priori kind
                        - thus altogether a synthetic a priori argument
                            / again like Kant’s
                        - thus self-determination

                        / e.g. what sort of mechanism for the latter causation?
            | employ again the argument of the default ethic, based on a default practical ground
                | argue that the best means of conforming to the default ethic’s most demanding duty
                  of extinction avoidance is to motivate ourselves to that end by arguing for
                  (and trying out) aeviternal ethics

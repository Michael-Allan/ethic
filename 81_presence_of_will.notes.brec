81. Notes on primal will being extant

    physical evidence
        : see `^*- ${same} gives one reason to believe that primal will is extant` @
          81_presence_of_will.brec
        - the evidence is the cosmosâ€™s fittingness to the maintenance of will
            : re `the maintenance of will` cf. `^*-.+primality is essential to will$`s @
              21_primality.brec
            : note : this suggests an instance of cosmological fine tuning,
              but one that is immune from the anthropic objection
                : see @ ~/code/WP3/way/ethic/precarious_conditions.brec
            - it indicates (in being constentent with the proposition) that (a crucial premise)
              will exists and always has
                : re `always has` see `only ever so \(always was so\)` @ ._/11_objective_basis_2.brec
            - thereby it also indicates (likewise) that (a crucial conclusion) will may transcend
              the temporal boundary of our cosmos, thus making the object of moral duty attainable
        + add a note promising the evidence, it being deferred pending completion of the analysis
          that pinpoints the type|nature of that evidence

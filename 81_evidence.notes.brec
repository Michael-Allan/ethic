81. Notes on physical evidence indicating that primal will once existed

    : re `physical evidence` see `^*- ${same}.+that primal will once existed$`s @ 81_evidence.brec
    - the evidence is the cosmosâ€™s fittingness to the maintenance of will
        : note : this suggests an instance of cosmological fine tuning,
          but one that is immune from the anthropic objection
            : see @ ~/code/WP3/way/ethic/precarious_conditions.brec
        - it indicates (in being consistent with expectation) that (a crucial premise)
          primal will is extant
            : re `expectation` viz.  `A determination to endure is expected for any extant primal will$`
              @ 41_determination_to_endure.brec
            : re `primal will is extant` see 81_evidence.brec
        - thereby it also indicates (likewise) that (a crucial conclusion) will may transcend
          the temporal boundary of our cosmos, thus making the object of moral duty attainable

            - my plan to ground the ethic by reaching across the boundary between ethics and science,
              seemingly incommensurable fields, might benefit from the method that Jackson describes
              for such a purpose: show the core structure of the former *also* to be core to the latter

                : ad `the method that Jackson describes` : ibid. p. 282
                - already my schemata of the theoretic formulae are structural and make use of variables,
                  more-or-less of the sort that Jackson mentions
                    : re `schemata` see e.g. `schema of the Taylor-Wright formula` @ ../12_teleo_object_subject/24.brec
                - the field-dependent variables in the schemata itself (my neutral bridge across fields)
                  I could free completely, then bind them to ethical/practical terms on the one side,
                  and scientific/theoretic terms on the other

              ‘the normative features of… reason… find their natural ground’ — seems itself to lack

                  selection [aside from reproductive] that act on inanimate, natural entities that are
                  best captured by field theory …  Certain inanimate entities have the single “end”
                  of persistence and growth in relation to the field(s) within which they are immersed.
                  When selective forces [fields] can act directly on an entity, from above, so to speak,
                  they sculpt [it in] such a way that it possesses functions and goals.

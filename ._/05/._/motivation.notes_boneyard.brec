    - I call it *the community of our rational nature*, for otherwise I cannot avow it as my end.
        - This is (for me at least) a community in the sense both of a group and of (however the
          dictionary defines it) one’s participation in the group, in the company that one finds there.
    - The chance connection/calculation in the moment of automomy explains the sense in what I do
      (taking up the moral law) but in no way moves me.
        - This is a strange thing.
        - I feel that in entering the self-determined community (taking both the end and the law)
          already I have the issue at hand and have secured what I sought, secured the end.
        - The explanation perhaps has to do with:
            • Pursuing an end beyond my span, beyond my physical attainment
            • Answering *now* what moves me, and so satisfying it,
              which is coming home where I belong
        - This dichotomy in turn reflects that of the two meanings of community —
          and those two meanings are now crucial.
    - The authority and binding force of the moral law is then carried (for me)
      by my choice in taking it as my law.
    + Get to the binary choice, for it recalls the question of what moves me
        - The first (sense of the word) enables me to look out from the vantage of the present
          through the decades [if not centuries] to come, and into the clear night.
        - Hence the binary choice and recall of the question of what moves me,
          whose answer then allows me to answer the remaining questions.
        - But I think this ought to be prefigured by the two clues that brought me to the ethic.
            1) The view on the clear night, being moved to what is offered.
                - From this, I *promise* to address motivation.
                + Put these reflections on motivation therefore *after* the precepts,
                  so concluding the ethic|essay.
            2) My practical insight regarding the question ‘to what end’.
                - From this, I go into the conditions of rational agency, and thence the precepts.
        - Natural inclination re the binary choice.
        - Looking to *understand* that inclination.
        - Seeing the choice from a vantage free of that inclination.
        - Thence to the dichotomy of meaning in ‘community’.
            - Two senses of the word ‘community’ are operative here, a group that shares
              and a state of sharing, and in the distinction between the two lies the key
              to the questions I set out to answer.
        - Thence, after pondering what I can avow in the way of a definition of ‘community’, etc.,
          I reflect:
            a) moved by sense of sharing
            b) what I value, for it is value that moves me
            c) back to the thought that what I value is reason, seeking to hold on to it
                / An inference from quotidian recurring stabs of fear *correlated* (as noted in
                  earlier versions of ethic) with fumbling of means or confusion about ends.
            d) recalling the sense that otherwise I felt I would be letting someone down
            e) then the cookie, and Margie (balloon story), and the realization of proving unworthy
              not only of the gift, but also the gift giver
            f) then I take my sense of value not only from the gift, but also the giver?
            g) it finally enters my mind that the gift and the giver are one and the same
            h) from the gratitude I felt as a child when my mother gave me the cookie, to that I felt on
              finding community among the stars when once I allwed room for the belief in their design
            i) the realization that not only are the gift and the giver one and the same, but they
              are so much a part of me that, although I can think myself separate in order to consider
              the binary choice posed by the calculus of will vs. chance, I can hardly choose otherwise
              once I understand what the choice means.
    - Summary of what moves me.
        - To maintain [a sense of] self worth by the only measure of worth I know,
          held in such high regard and depth of dependency.
        - What moves me (community as sharing) equates precisely to the *content* of the moral law.
          Hence Kant-like, my motive is fundamentally right.
            - The law of rational community is moral (= the moral law) only when applied
              to its proper end (community of our rational nature).
                + Bear this in mind in what follows; it might serve e.g. as pretext.
            - Reflecting now both that this internal motive pre-exists in the exteral (natural) law,
              is tied so tightly to the end (I can hardly separate the two), and seeing that end
              (endurance of the community as group) (again of necessity) in the clear night.
            - Then looking into that clear night and seeing the telic aspect (‘light’ our ‘passage’).
                - The light of the stars marking our passage through the dark time that lies ahead
                  (so the telic aspect, community as group), and that light being deliberately lit
                  [a light that shows the way home] (so the motive aspect, community a sharing).
                - But here (again) the tight tie to the motive, sharing aspect (‘deliberately lit’).
            - I look up and see design in the distances through which we must pass,
              a design whose possibility (if not truth) is a necessary inference of reason within me.
                - I look around me see design in the organic nature through which we came,
                  as far in the past as traces extend.
                - It makes me wonder whether there is a sense in which the moral law (the law of
                  rational community) is a truth not only of reason, but also a of nature.
                    : ad `truth.+of reason` : By way of the inference that grounds the law.
            - How to name the feeling aroused here otherwise than ‘awe’ and ‘sublime’, as follows?
                + Arouse this in the reader, because I can summon the (simple) rhetoric
                  in place of the clumsy notes above.
    expansive definition of rational community
        - Crucial in showing both our generosity in defining rational community,
          and the value we place on {rational agency|practical reason} itself:
            : see notepad:2023-3-12d
                • How what fascinates us about other creatures is the practical reason we see in them.
                • How the first thing we did with computers (think Turing Test) was dream of how, one day,
                  we might converse with these ‘giant brains’.
                • And, of course, the night sky.
            - We see practical reason everywhere, and foster it wherever we can.
    frame story
        • Standing as does Kant at the end of the second critique, contemplating related dichotomies.
            : cf. @ ~/work/ethic/._/05/._/origin.notes_boneyard.brec
            : see notepad:2023-4-2a : Dichotomy of a object/rational end without, and subjective/emotive
              within.  Fine rhetoric if I can use it: ‘But now take yourself back to childhood, [to a]
              world… full of bright lights and wonder, and in that frame of mind listen as I tell you …’
                : cf. notepad:2023-4-1k
    warrant for consideration of motivation
        - This could go anywhere, or even be omitted.
            / It is a demand more of rhetoric, e.g. in giving context for sake of reader orientation,
              than of reason.
        - What might *move* me to adopt the moral law?
            - I have *justificatory* reason to do so.
                / My inference of that law (with its proper end) is based on a normative interpretation
                  of the natural law that one (as a rational agent) would need justification to accept.
                  But the proper end of the moral law suffices as a reason, being justified in itself,
                  because the moral law would then follow as a necessary means to that end.
                - That would not suffice as a motive reason, however.
                    ∵ I might choose instead to pursue some other justified end.
            - One might argue that I have a moral or rational obligation to choose the moral law.
                / My default ethic could be interpreted in this way, yielding the same precepts exactly
                  and (at least on the rational ground) the proper end of the law, and the law itself
                  as the necessary means to that end.  And I may indeed end up arguing for that.
                - But such a formal reason is unlikely to suffice as a *motive* reason.
                    ∵ Humans at least (if not all rational agents) are resourceful enough to find
                      their way around such arguments; or simply to ignore them.
                        / It would be like ‘pushing spaghetti’ therefore.

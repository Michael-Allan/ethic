81. Notes on primal will being extant

    physical evidence
        : see `^*- ${same} gives one reason to believe that primal will is extant` @

        - the evidence is the cosmosâ€™s fittingness to the maintenance of will
            : note : this suggests an instance of cosmological fine tuning,
              but one that is immune from the anthropic objection
                : see @ ~/code/WP3/way/ethic/precarious_conditions.brec
            - it indicates (in being constentent with the proposition) that (a crucial premise)
              primal will is extant
                : re `the proposition` see
                  `A determination to endure is essential to any extant primal will$` @
                  41_determination_to_endure.brec
                : re `primal will is extant` see 81_presence_of_will.brec
            - thereby it also indicates (likewise) that (a crucial conclusion) will may transcend
              the temporal boundary of our cosmos, thus making the object of moral duty attainable

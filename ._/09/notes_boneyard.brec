        - I use the argument of the default ethic to warrant my expectation that *even the moral skeptic*
          (suspending judgement) is morally bound by the precepts
            - hooked by his own admission (of skepticism, which is mere suspension)
              that unbenownst he might actually be bound by a moral precept
            - hooked into seeking knowledge that, by his own skeptism (and the long history ethics),
              would be difficult and likely far in future
            - hooked then into the maintenance of rational agency, and therewith the same precepts
                - all as though the object of his doubt, the supreme moral obligation to maintain reason,
                  were true after all

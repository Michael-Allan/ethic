    ⁠\bf Q_7⁠: what might that practical ground or other moral fundament be?

        / here ‘agency’ means ‘ability or capacity to act’

      \ ?+ put the constitutive argument (with indeterminate object of self-causal binding)
      \   into the default ethic, as further warrant for a conclusion of moral bearing
            | [\rather] what constitutes willing is an effective binding to [that] binding itself
                : see notepad:2024-11-22d
                - binding is the necessary object of the effective binding, not agency
                - agency is, however, entailed in that binding
                - one can *get* willing through an effective binding to binding to ⁠O⁠,
                  where ⁠O⁠ is any object, including agency
                    - but it’s not necessary to state any object except binding simpliciter
                    ? could we *in practice* so minimize it?
                        - no, an *instance* of willing cannot be *synchronically* recursive [like that]
                            - the recursion (self-causality) must at least play out *in time*,
                              and probably also *in a population*
        how fasten on agency as the stable ground?
            / viz. not only as the object of the self-causal binding that constitutes will
            | do not, it is not required up front
                - the two foundations, namely a default ground and a constitutive aim,
                  are mutually compatible and complementary
                    - moreover the former supports the latter
                    ∵ I may take the moral bearing to hold temporarily *at least* as concerns
                      the aim of binding
                        ∵ one has reason to aim at the binding that is constitutive of action
                          as a means maintaining agency
                            ∵ maintaining agency is entailed by the default ground
                                / viz. pending knowledge of whether practical reason has a stable
                                  grounding reason, and what it consists in
                        ∴ the constitutive and logical norms here coincide
                        ∴ they here they achieve moral bearing

                            / some constitutivist theorists hold that a constitutive norm as a premise
                              does not suffice to warrant a conclusion of that norm’s moral bearing,
                              but must be supplemented also by a reason for conformance
                                : see also
                - together they are|yield ample resources to counter|answer the shmagencist skeptic
                  and maintain (at least temporarily) the moral bearing of the constitutive norm
                    / some constitutivist theorists hold that a constitutive norm as a premise
                      does not suffice to warrant a conclusion of that norm’s moral bearing,
                      but must be supplemented also by a reason for conformance
                        / but I think what is here required is a reason *or other motive*
                        / and I think it’s wanted specifically to counter|answer shmagencist skeptics
                    - the default ground yields an answer, in the form of a default reason,
                      to any shmagencist who is open to being convinced by logic
                        ∵ one has reason to aim at the binding that is constitutive of action
                          as a means maintaining agency

                    - another answer, perhaps more convincing to other shmagencists, goes like this:
                        - shmagencist skeptics like you will die
                            - to the extent that our collective will strengthens, you will be replaced
                              by non-skeptics who are bound to the binding that action requires,
                              which binding you lack
                            - in that case, your kind would headed for extinction
                                ∵ your extinction (in this sense) is part of the constitutive aim
                                  of action whose moral bearing you deny
                        - the force of this argument would be inversely proportional to how widely
                          such shmagencists believe their skepticism can extend in the population
                            - this extent is probably proportional the degree in which
                              the constitutive aim is alienating vs. familiar
                                / this may be the reason behind Katsafanas’s claim that a constitutivist
                                  must say something about alienation
                            + consider taking this as my lead to explore the entailments
                              of the constitutive aim in light of its moral bearing
                                / which bearing the above answers suffice (at least for now) to uphold
                N.B. meantime the constitutive norm of action bears on us morally in the form of a duty
                  toward binding ourselves to conformance, which binding entails overcoming shmagencist
                  skepticism and any other obstacles to our being so bound
                    ∵ I may take the moral bearing to hold temporarily *at least* as concerns
                      the aim of binding
                        : see
                    - no doubt this overcoming of obstacles will include, where prudent,
                      a search for a logical basis of convincing and thus binding others
                        - no doubt that search will include, in turn, the search for a practical ground
                    ∴ even without a moral bearing, in practice the constitutive aim of action
                      is toward supplying *its own* moral bearing
                        - it has self-creative power, to pull itself up by its own bootstraps,
                          and thereafter staying power
            | hypothesis|postulate of agency being a (lawfully) closed system
                    : ad `postulate` : might be too strong a word; what I aim at here is a coherent
                      theory, which does not require the warrant of an explicit postulate
                    : ad `hypothesis` : might be the wrong word, in that it (at least) suggests an
                      experiment; unless seeking coherence in entailments counts as an experiment

                      the system are contingent; whereas the effects of the system on itself
                      *as a self-reproductive system* are lawful, constitutive of that system
                - we have practical reason and a moral obligation (using our self-determinate freedom)
                  to determine for ourselves what this object of our binding ought to be
                - both the constitution of action/willing and its origin (and present status quo),
                  point to it being a self-reproductive system, thus a closed, self-explanatory system

                      further warrant for this conjecture
                - following closure on its self-reproduction, the operation of the system results in
                  an on-going collapse of its aetiological explanation onto itself
                    - and where the system includes the power of reason, this collapse might also
                      be reflected by the practical standpoint

                - with a hypothesis|postulate both that agency is a closed system, and that (by symmetry)
                  its closure is reflected also from the practical standpoint, then:
                    - it makes no sense to demand a further (practical) reason for agency,
                      because such a reason would contradict the premise of a closed system
                        ∵ the self-causation that yields function=purpose from a theoretic standpoint
                          *also* (by the hypothetic reflection) yields it from practical standpoint,
                          and purpose from a practical standpoint is an end
                            ?+ do I mean: because the system itself generated that purpose|end,
                              it makes no sense to ask for a further purpose|end?

                    - since *I* cannot will, yet willing is inescapable for me,
                      it must be something *else* that is exercising my will

            | while I cannot fully succeed in doing what (by willing) I commit to,
              namely making myself a cause free of external determining causes,
              reason demands that I aim in that direction, taking my agency as an end
                - and always, ∵ willing is inescapable for me
                - likewise reason demands that *we* aim in the direction of making ourselves a cause
                  by taking *our* agency (or agency simpliciter) as an end
                    - and again, willing (of shared ends) is inescapable for us
                        / I define plural agents on the basis alone of shared ends

                          it does not clearly hold for plural willing

                ? is this alternative explanation based on a faulty memory of the notepad contents,
                  namely in its implication that logical constraint (i) is a practical constraint,
                  and thus untrue?

                        - in the notepad I deem (i) a mere epistemic constraint

                    - no, not untrue
                        - logical constraint (i) *is* a practical constraint

                        - *prior* to will, (i) is perhaps a mere epistemic constraint
                        - but with will comes a *commitment*, and thus the constraint is one of aiming
                          at self-determination, not merely believing in it
                        : see notepad:2024-10-14a
            | the ground itself, whether agency simpliciter or the universal plural agent,
              comes directly from logical constraint (ii)
                : see notepad:2024-8-21b(ii) : ‘in willing the object as its end the subject commits
                  to making *itself* a cause in effecting that object, which does necessitate
                  (ii) the subject itself as a viable rational agent.’
                - this might not be the same as the self-determination constraint (i) of being free
                  of external determining causes, for that might be a mere epistemic constraint

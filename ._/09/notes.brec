            - here to ask, ‘are we morally obligated to endure?’
            - and then, ‘who are we, that are so obligated?’
                - for the obligation gives rise to a question of identity

            / that much I shall do
        - yet I cannot shake the original existential hook
            : re `original` see `from ${same} experience$` : introduction, leading section
            - thus my warrant for the telicity of the moral command I now propose
        - analysis by expansion of algebraic moral command, thus involving reason
            : see notepad:2023-9-10b
            → ‘what ought to be [done]?’
                → S ought to be [done]
                → take S as your end
                : cf. notepad:2023-9-10b
            - avoid the misconception that I merely *take* the command to be moral law at this point,
              for here I analyze on the assumption that actually it is
            ? does not the argument of this leg show that one truly *can* be autonomous?
                - one can set *any* end as law, the content matters not provided it coheres,
                  viz. provided it (its enforcement) contradicts no entailed right
                    - and provided that any contestant of its enforcement who stands on a moral
                      [or generally normative] ground would thereby contradict himself
                        / as is the case for a contestant of the rights of personal security and freedom
                - my license for autonomy (for making law) comes by authority of logic
                    - this points to reason, the power of mind based on logic
                    - and the question ‘what to do?’ points to *practical* reason,
                      the faculty of answering this question
                    / and eventually I will learn that I make law not as
                      an autocratic legislator, but rather as a representative legislator
                      working on behalf of reason, for I am an *agent* of reason
                - the law one makes is truly moral in as far as concerns the core rights
                  and perfect (negative) duties that correspond to them
                    / for these hold regardless of S, and are obligatory in the sense
                      of being universally enforceable; that is to say, one has licence
                      to enforce them universally, viz. licence to make moral law as such
                    - the imperfect (positive) duties, such as that of S,
                      are imperfectly moral in falling short of being *both* absolute and obligatory
                        / these being criteria of moral precepts|principles
                        - they are obligatory only for one who *takes* S to be a moral duty,
                          which makes them agent relative and thus non-absolute
                - this gives me a better (or further) warrant for asking ‘what to do?’
                    : re `‘what to do\?’` see `${same}` @ `^^40$`i
                    - I am in a process of ascertaining moral law either by discovery or creation
                        - but how am I, short of being Moses, to discover an *obligatory* norm?
                            / the criterion of obligation is the difficult one to prove
                        - better to make and enforce the law (or have it enforced by society),
                          for then the obligation is built in
                    - so I want to know what law to make
                        / e.g. one we might reach a stable consensus on, once we have
                          (as is our right) a system of ends justification
                    - of course, in the present context (a normative ethic),
                      I need no warrant to propose a moral law as such, viz. to make moral law
                        - and the licence here, to propose/make a plurality of such laws,
                          mirrors the reality of ethics past and present
                        - yet still, an understanding of the licence itself may yield some opportunity
                    - stability of the core rights in theory
                        - and a felt responsibility to secure those rights in practice
                            - I grew up in a society that guarantees them
                            - I hold them dear, seeing they are not guaranteed everywhere
                        - one means of securing them might lie in the choice of end,
                          in the particular law that is made
                            / an end of reason, for example, makes provision and maintenance
                              of those rights a duty
                        - warrant then to ask ‘what S? what law to make?’

            | full rights may be inferred once the end is known to be practical reason
                ∵ duty to an end implies a right to its realization
                    - and since the end is conceived in its fullness, it implies a full right
                ∵ in willing an object, one necessarily acts in its realization where it both
                  lies in one’s power to do so, and would contravene no other justified end
                    : cf. @ `^*! not just any.+end would entail.+rationality$` @ `^*20$`
                    - this remains true even of *mere* will, as failure to act under these circumstances
                      would *belie* will
        ? how infer from mere will (thought) the positive duty of providing/maintaining
          the means of freedom of action
                - the problem here being that practical reason (as an end) does not clearly,
                  or at least not directly, require freedom of action
            | the indirect requirement suffices for the purpose
                - namely: freedom of action ← power of action ← practical reason
                    - true ∵ practical reason would make no sense — would be a dead letter —
                      absent a power of action
                - however weak the entailment might be, it suffices for the positive duty
                    / which duty alone rests on it, for the corresponding right is prototypic
          \ | an autotelic principle of rational agency, rather than practical reason
          \     - for freedom of action *is* necessary to agency
          \     - and the prototypic rights *do* arise from agency in conjunction with logic,
          \       so pointing to rational agency as the source, which in this defends itself

          \             - it would introduce too many contortions into my argument

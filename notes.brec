                      (to the effect) that always reason seeks the unconditioned condition

                • together the two are mythic, telling whence we come and whither we go
                    - the original cause of the present ethic tells where we come from
                    - the final cause or practical ground of the default ethic tells
                      where (properly) we are (or ought to be) going
            • each is argued (from its premise) by the method of conceptual analysis

                    • Nick Bostrom (2013) - Proposes that we have a stronger moral reason to prevent
                      catastrophes that would kill the entire human population compared to
                      smaller-scale disasters, based on the unique value of humanity's continued
                      existence.

                - This list is relatively short because many arguments for avoiding extinction are
                  based on maximizing goods like happiness or the number of lives lived, which were
                  excluded per the query instructions.  The philosophers listed above argue for
                  humanity's intrinsic or unique value as a reason to avoid extinction, rather than
                  solely focusing on maximizing positive outcomes.

                - here it failed to archive the Breccian Web image files
                    / probably ∵ I had (prior to 2025-1-8) been using an Apache `IndexIgnore` directive
                      to omit the image files from my server’s directory index
                    - it did, however, archive their `.brec` source files
                / it repointed the hyperlinks for the Breccian source files in the directory indeces
                  (to their `.brec.xht` images ∵ it ran (a copy of) the same script as the server),
                  but still one can access them by manipulating the URL in the browser’s address bar

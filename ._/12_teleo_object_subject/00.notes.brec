                            - it remains correct to speak of them as ends in practice
                            - we would add only that they are *invalid* as *rational ends*
                              in practice
                                ∵ the practical interpretation of the formulae rests on
                                  reason/justification for action, as opposed to
                                  reason/justification for believe
                        - no non-subject X (e.g. artifact, behaviour) can pass the existential/selection
                          clause (s) in regard to end E except in virtue of some subject selecting X
                          as a means to E and therefore himself *having* end E
                            ? what then happens if the subject selects X merely *believing* E
                              to be his end *when in truth it fails the test*?
                                - E remains *in practice* a true end, but invalid
                                    : see `^*- those.+which are false in theory remain true in practice$`
                            - this dependency/supervenience on the subject/person case of X,
                              which is the problematic one in the unextended formula,
                              thereby makes *all* (practical) cases problematic

                            - this focus on reasons-giving would support my claim that prescriptive
                              autoreplication is *always* necessary for practical telicity, too,
                              not merely for its being *well formed*
                                ∵ reason fails unless one’s practical end is grounded by an end justified
                                  in itself, viz. the prescriptive autoreplicator of autotelic reason

                          outside that of overall coherence
                            - this by default, pending some special argument to the contrary

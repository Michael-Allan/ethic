            - as an explanatory theory, a normative ethic must take its principles
              from one or another source independent of the thing to be explained,
              which is normativity in the absolute sense: moral normativity, aka morality

                    \ God (voluntarism) is constested

                    - there simply is no uncontested source of morals in contemporary society
                    - yet reason stands out in another regard: among its uncontested principles
                      are those of practical reason, the concern of which (what to do) bears
                      a likeness to that of morality (what *ought* to be done)

                  do. The rules of morality are the rules that make social life possible, and social life
                  is necessary for human beings. Hobbes and Pufendorf clearly supposed that in many cases
                  this consideration could be motivationally sufficient as well. Pufendorf, especially,
                  says that in the absence of obligation we would still do what is right because it is
                  useful. The legislator is not invoked to supply the content of morality or to explain
                  why people are often motivated to do what is right. The legislator is necessary to make
                  obligation possible, that is, to make morality normative.’ p. 30

                          giving one a negative reason to recognize its authority
                            ? is not the collective basis of this reason jarring,
                              maybe even begging the question?
            ? how infer that a normative source must (ultimately) be also a|the creative source?
                / e.g. sharpening my fumbling attempts (elsewhere) at this
                ? does it matter that both types of source (normative and creative) can entrain will?

                    ? might it be that the one effective|effective mechanism to oppose existential
                      hazard (which I think means to oppose chance *period*) results in a normative
                      ethic, and always has (for us) in the past (for the different mechanisms)
                        - here opposition to chance (as a remedy) would save the old argument,
                          for it was only the remedy of chance on which it foundered
                            : privately see ~/work/ethic/._/04_law_or_extinction/README.brec
                            - chance cannot be a means of *opposing* hazard (a remedy),
                              for it is the opposite: it is *surrendering* to hazard
                            - here the mechanism to *oppose* existential hazard
                              would be the *willful* indefinite reduction of *p*
                        - then this would explain morality itself

                                - law alone opposes chance
                                    - law here being either of nature, or of practice

                                               how do chance-defeating mechanisms relate to law?
                                                - law can oppose chance only through a mechanism
                                                  that makes it effective in that regard

        - both types of source (normative and creative) can entrain will
        - criteria from Korsgaard
            - my theory must survive reflection on the normative question, namely ‘whether we
              really have reason to yield to’ the norms that I claim
                : e.g. file:///home/mike/library/1992,%20Korsgaard.%20The%20sources%20of%20normativity.pdf :
                  ‘The normative question, then, is whether we really have reason to yield to these desires
                  and to try to be virtuous people.’ (etc., for this is the guiding question of her whole
                  lecture series) p. 54
                - one would reflect on why one took the autotelic principle as law,
                  and whether those reasons still hold
                    - the necessity of avoiding what one cannot accept (our extinction)
                      and whether that still justifies taking the principle as law
                    - the feeling that moved one to take the principle as law,
                      and whether still it moves one to that
                        - here I think of motivation, lineal rational community
                ? can it survive the sensible knave test?
                    : see file:///home/mike/library/1992,%20Korsgaard.%20The%20sources%20of%20normativity.pdf
                      : p. 57
                    - if the knave understands what law means and does not like to contradict himself,
                      then yes

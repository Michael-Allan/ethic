    objective practical ground: an object ⁠O⁠ that, taken as an end, suffices as a determinant reason for
      will and action; an end for which it makes no sense (in a chain of reason seeking) to demand
      further justification, to ask ‘to what end ⁠O⁠?’ and insist on an answer other than ⁠O⁠

        : notepad:2024-9-2b
        - given the premise of no such knowledge (judged by some more-or-less objective criterion
          like rough consensus), it would make no sense to demand a (further) reason for willing
          this object (because that would contradict the premise, which denies any such reason)
          and therefore that object (taken as an end) is by definition a ground
            - likewise any other object (taken as an end) would be a ground
            !! ∴ there is no default ground by this argument

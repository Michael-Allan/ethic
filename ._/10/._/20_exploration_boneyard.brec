        axiom: having a duty to ⁠\phi⁠, one thereby has a duty to all that necessarily
          attends ⁠\phi⁠-ing; to each of its conditions and entailments, that is

            / this is analytic
    - to ⁠\phi⁠, in the present case, is to take ⁠O⁠ as an end; in other words, to will ⁠O⁠
    - to will an object is to commit to making myself an *active cause* in its realization,
      and thereby to making it an *effect of my actions*
        : see `^*Kant.+1785.+Groundwork` @ ../sources.brec : ‘for in the willing of an object,
          as my effect, my causality is already thought, as an acting cause’  4:417

        - to think [in terms] of (logical) cause and effect, the power of theoretic reason

                ?+ am I right in claiming the necessity of *logical* thought here,
                  as opposed to mere causation?

                        - here I need only (as condition) the belief in my power of action
            - this might be termed objective
        - to think of figuring in this as a self-made cause, the power of practical reason
            - this might be termed subjective
        - to commit to being such a self-made cause, a belief in having
          the power of self-determined|initiated action
      \ - in unified combination: rational agency
      \\ no, as agency here is mere belief — pending duty, which alone must extend to the reality

    - we turn now to the inference of entailed rights
        - to begin, consider the duty of the original proposition in light of the following definition

            ‘moral law’ (in some systems of ethics) an absolute principle defining the criteria
              of right action (whether conceived as a divine ordinance or a truth of reason).
                : see `^*Pearsall.+2003.+Oxford dictionary of English`s @
                  ~/work/ethic/._/03_origin_hypothesis/sources_boneyard.brec

        - we should ignore for now the parenthetic qualifications, as the source of this duty is unknown
            - and whether in scope it covers all the criteria of right action, this too is yet unknown
        - but we certainly have in this duty a principle that is absolute and defines at least one
          criterion of right action

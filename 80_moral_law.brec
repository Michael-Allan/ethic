Moral law

    - If there is but one law that regulates the membership of a community of rational beings *as such*,
      then it must be that we give and allow to each the conditions of [practical] reason.
        - To a helpless child we give personal security, on coming of age the means of freedom
          and ends justification.
        - Failing this, we are no rational community at all, but something less.

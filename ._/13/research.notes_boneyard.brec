                c) ‘the function of X is O’ means:
                        i) O is a consequence (or result) of X’s being there
                        ii) X is there because it does O
                    : see https://www.jstor.org/stable/2183766 : Wright, 1973. p. 161
                - (i) has a complicated phrasing compared to his earlier formula (a)
                - Wright justifies the complication as necessary to exclude certain problematic cases
                    ' The most easily generable set of cases to be excluded is of this kind:
                      oxygen combines readily with hemoglobin, and that is the (etiological) reason
                      it is found in human bloodstreams.  But there is something colossally fatuous
                      in maintaining that the function of that oxygen is to combine with hemoglobin,
                      even though it is there because it does that.  The function of the oxygen
                      in human bloodstreams is providing energy in oxidation reactions, not combining
                      with hemoglobin.  Combining with hemoglobin is only a means to that end.
                        : note : ibid. p. 159
                        - here he takes X = oxygen, the contextual ‘there’ = within human bloodstreams,
                          the function O = provision of energy in oxidation reactions,
                          and moreover O ≠ combining with hemoglobin (the case to exclude)
                        - Wright assumes (maybe for ease of illustration) that oxygen enters the blood
                          only *after* combining with hemoglobin
                - yet I prefer the earlier formula
                    : re `earlier formula` see `^*a\) ‘X has end O’ means:$`
                    ∵ it is simpler and clearer
                    ∵ it handles the same exclusion with ease
                        - let X = blood oxygen
                        - let O = energy provision
                            - clause (i) holds obviously
                            - clause (ii) holds ∵ X is defeasible on (i): had it been the case
                              that blood oxygen caused no energy provision, then oxygen would never
                              have combined with hemoglobin and entered the blood in the first place
                        - let O = combining with hemoglobin
                            - clause (i) fails because blood oxygen does *not* cause
                              combining with hemoglobin; rather the reverse is the case
                                : N.B. `^*- Wright assumes.+oxygen enters.+only.+after.+combining`s
                                : note : Cf. ibid., p. 161.  ‘Its combining with hemoglobin
                                  is emphatically not a consequence of oxygen's being in our blood;
                                  just the reverse is true.  On the other hand, its producing energy
                                  is a result of its being there.’

    ? what are the conditions for the purpose binding qua moral?
        : re `purpose binding` see `^*Q. are we morally bound to a purpose of endurance\?$` @ 07.brec
        • that autotelicity is a norm of reason
            : see `reason is normally autotelic$` @ `^*.\\bf T_r.:` @ 15.brec
        • that the autotelic norm of reason is morally binding
            - we know of no hard and fast conditions for normativity qua moral
            - we discern only expected conditions of varying weights [of expectation]
            - we expect that such normativity would be:
                ⁃ absolute
                ⁃+
                   ⋮
            - the criterion [[by which] to answer|judge] must then be a favourable balance in the weight
              of expectations met versus unmet
    ? do those conditions hold?
        • that autotelicity is a norm of reason

        • that the autotelic norm of reason is morally binding,
          that it meets on balance our expectations of being:
            ⁃ absolute

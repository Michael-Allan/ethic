    outline, of the bare argument, its logical structure isolated in the fewest lines
        : privately see ~/work/ethic/._/09/notes.brec
        ? how incorporate the argument structure in the text saliently, making it ever apparent?
            - clearly marking the structural members
                / e.g. questions and answers, argument legs, propositions and their supports
            - summarizing the structure both at the outset, and in conclusion
            - titling of structural members
                - yet let the titles accrue after the structure, led by the structure, naturally
                    / viz. no structure for sake of titling
                - and only where titling would improve the text

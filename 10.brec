    - I often pause to look at the sky on clear nights
    - many years ago, I had a thought that sticks with me
        - in the limit of light speed and the vastness of space lies an existential refuge
          where we might endure forever
    - at length this thought brought me to ethics, and now to the question,
      ‘are we morally obligated to such an end?’

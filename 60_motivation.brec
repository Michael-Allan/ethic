    - What is left over if I subtract the normativity of reason from that of morality?
        \ Here seeking a path from the (hypothesized) absolute value/worth of my rational nature
        \ to the precepts of a normative ethic.
    \ Hence Margie might suggest an answer, for she would introduce a sense of social worthiness
    \ that enters in the next file.

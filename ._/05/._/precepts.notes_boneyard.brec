        stoppage of rights violation
            - The rule allowing for this is that (at least in default) others are permitted
              to enforce one’s compliance with a negative duty.
                ∵ Inasfar as the force merely effects what one has obligated oneself to effect,
                  it cannot violate one’s rights.
                    / The authority is oneself, via one’s choosing to take up the law.
            ?+ Can this be effective in practice, given that it affects only those
               who willingly taken up the law?
                ?+ What does Kant say?
                    - I think depends on the proposition that one is *required* to take up the law,
                      forced by reason.
                if( necessary )
                    - Consider arguing on default grounds that one has a moral and/or rational obligation
                      to choose the moral law.

                    - This would yield the same precepts exactly, including the crucial negative duties,
                      which then everyone would have reason to comply with (whether willingly or not).

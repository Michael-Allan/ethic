<h1 lang='en-CA'>Sketch of an existential ethic</h1>
<section lang='en-CA'> <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
        After long being concerned that we are in a state of existential precarity,
        I found what I think is a workable solution for dealing with the problem,
        one whose theory I now sketch in the form of a normative ethic.
        This then is a theory both of moral normativity and of existential practice;
        it explains both the source of our moral norms, and the means of securing our existence.</p>

            Reason has become self-stable, self-reproductive and self-determined
            by an autotelic principle, which is therefore constitutive of reason,
            agents of reason and their society, sub specie aeternitatis.</li>
        <li    value='60'>
            (<a href='60.brec'>precepts</a>)<br/>
            Agents of reason conform more-or-less to the autotelic principle and together
            enforce it in society as moral law, particularly in modern (aka Western)
            democracies where it informs the basic structure of society.</li>
        <li    value='70'>
            (<a href='70.brec'>prospect</a>)<br/>
            An autotelic principle of reason has the potential to oppose contingency and sustain reason
            against existential hazard indefinitely.</li>
        <li    value='80'>
            (<a href='80.brec'>motivation</a>)<br/>
            I entertain the possibility that the autotelic principle is ancient beyond measure,
            seeing it reflected in the structure of the cosmos.</li></ol></section>

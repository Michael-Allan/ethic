Moral law

    - If there is but one law that regulates a community of rational agents as such,
      then it {is|must be} that we give and allow to each the conditions of practical reason.
        - To a helpless child we give personal security, on coming of age the means of freedom
          and ends justification.
        - Failing this, we are not a rational community, {but\we are} something less.
    - Fittingness to a moral community is determined [at least] in part by compliance with the law.
        - To be judged in non-compliance is to be judged unfit and unworthy [of] the company of others.
        - Here arises that particular feeling of shame that attends a judgement of moral wrongdoing.
        - In this sense, the law regulates the membership of the community.
            - The law is enforced by exclusion.
            - The community comprises those who abide by the law.

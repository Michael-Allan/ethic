    !! high and dry, unable to make a confident start
        | I lack confidence in my arguments because none is convincing in itself
            - though the arguments cohere well enough, and each is at least plausible
            ? is it true that *none* is convincing?
                | at least one argument is convincing in itself
                    - stability entails the autotelic principle, whereby it *is* constitutive of reason
                        - I can make this argument directly at the outset
                            / it does not depend on the full outlook argument
                                : see 70.brec
                            - it depends only on:
                                a) disengagement from the existential mechanisms
                                  of the other normative sources
                                b) theoretic and practical necessity vs. contingency
                                c) the criterion of success vs. failure of reason
                                    - not only the constitutive argument, but also the principles
                                      of reason depend on criterion (c), and perhaps (b) too
                        + consider starting with this
                            / much as originally planned, but with more confidence I hope
        | no rhetorical thread to weave through the arguments
            - though the arguments cohere well enough, I fail to come to grips with the task of writing
              them because I see no storyline or other rhetorical handle that would unify them
            | put motivation and meaning first, hanging the arguments confidently from that
                - there hooking the general reader, as I was hooked
                - thereafter holding him (and so maintaining confidence) through each argument

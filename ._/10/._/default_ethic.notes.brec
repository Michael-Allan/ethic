default ethic, notes

    : cf. `^*- I use the argument of the default ethic` @ ~/work/ethic/._/09/notes_boneyard.brec
    ?!! whether to introduce the default ethic, where and how to employ it?
            - for it can, after all, ground an imperfect duty of reason (or rational agency)
                / taken as an end, that is
                - here S is moral knowledge, or whatnot
                    : re `S` see `^*→ take ${same} as your end$` @ ~/work/ethic/._/09/notes.brec
                - but the attainment of moral knowledge, in turn, entails holding on to reason
                  (or rational agency) in the meantime, viz. indefinite maintenence
                - thus the result is much the same as for the autotelic principle
            - and it would yield a reason to engage in autonomy as part of the search for certainty
                / a practical part, complementing the theoretic part
            ?+ but only for proper moral skeptics (suspending judgement), not for deniers of morality?
                | it hardly matters (I need not open the question) for already I *prove* morality
                    : see `^*\+ state exactly how morality inheres in it$` @
                      `^*\| morality inheres in this$` @ autonomy.notes.brec
                | only for proper moral skeptics
                    - deniers of morality are not obligated through the default argument,
                      but rather through owing an argument of denial,
                      where they *themselves* are open to the skeptic’s doubt
                | for all, including deniers of morality
                    - for denial does not yield certainty
                        - lack of consensus warrants an agent-neutral claim of moral uncertainty
                    ?+ yet how can a denier be convinced by argument the validity of which he denies?
        | no, it fails to cohere with the rest of the argument, rather distracting from it
        | yes, but earlier than outlined
            : re `outlined` see ~/work/ethic/._/09/notes.brec
            - right after the (grounds of the) prior moral rights are uncovered|discovered
                : see `^*\?.+whence then do these rights originate\?$` @ autonomy.notes.brec
            - then the concept of morality hangs in the air, even if I deny its validity
            - reflecting on my ignorance of the full extent (or validity) of its norms
              then gives rise to the default ethic
        | yes, much as outlined
            : re `outlined` see ~/work/ethic/._/09/notes.brec

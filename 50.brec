    - what to do?
    - one way to answer:
            - it being an absolute question of practice
        - a practical reason, timeless and devoid of context
        - an end justified in itself, reason in itself
        - reason itself eternal
    - another way to answer:
            - it being an absolute question of action
        - an absolute principle of action
            - one way to find it:
        - an essence of action
            - one way to find it:
        - an existential mechanism of agency
        - one way to find it:
            - past origin of agency
            - two alternative origins
            - their existential mechanisms
            - our disengagement from them
            - causes of disengagement
            - common factor reason
        - another way to find it:
            - future prospects of agency
            - mathematic model of agential endurance
            - three alternatives: contingency, theoretic and practical necessity

            - only practical necessity could yield the sought principle
            - as nature by its laws is the seat of theoretic necessity,
              what [thing] by its principles is the seat of practical necessity?
                - reason suggests itself, as twice before it has shown itself pertinent
                    : re `twice before` see `^*- reason itself eternal$`
                    : re `twice before` see `^*- common factor reason$`
            - autotelic principle of reason
                / a principle of pure practical reason that Kant seems to have overlooked
                - warrant in a criterion common to all principles of practical reason,
                  namely success vs. failure of reason
                - an existential mechanism of reason, and only thereby of agency
                    - agency is here merely an auxilliary to reason
